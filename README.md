# Beta Bank

### Beta Bank is experiencing customer attrition, with clients gradually leaving each month. I recognize that retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

### My goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank soon. I have access to data on clients' past behavior and contract terminations, which will help in building an effective predictive model.

### I will develop a model that achieves the highest possible F1 score. To successfully complete this project, I need to ensure the F1 score is at least 0.59 on the test set. Additionally, I will measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 score to assess model performance comprehensively.
